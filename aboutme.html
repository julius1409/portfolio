        I am a student at TEXOVERSUM LDT with an international and historical academic background (International Baccalaureate; History with a focus on Modern History at the University of Vienna)
        and practical experience in brand communication, data analysis, e-commerce content management (with a focus on SEO and webshop optimisation),
        and organisational process improvement (benchmarking, cross-selling analysis, and assortment adjustments). My goal is to join a demanding, stimulating environment
        where I can apply my strengths while deliberately developing my weaker areas. I am driven by breaking complex challenges down to their essentials,
        analysing numbers, turning insights into clear actions, and understanding how my decisions influence outcomes, both positively and negatively.
        I enjoy working with people from different cultures and value being challenged by perspectives that differ from my own.
